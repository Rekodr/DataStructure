# Stack
This stack implemented here is just a basic one; by that I mean I will just implement the basic functionality of a stack such as : creation, push, pop and top. From these basic functinality, you should be able to implement others as you need.  The stack will be implemented using two different approach : the linked-list approach and the dynamic-array one. Note this stack is not generic. In fact, it only designed for integers. However, implement a generic like stack should not be that hard. You can refer to the project in the generic-C_linkedList in order to implement a generic like stack in C.

Note: use the which_Implementation.h file to pick to choose which implementaion you want to test with
